Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a 
scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.
We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the triplet , and the rating for Bob's challenge to be the triplet .
Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], and a[2] with b[2].
If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.
Comparison points is the total points a person earned.
